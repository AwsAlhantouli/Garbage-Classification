This project explores the application of deep learning models to automatically sort garbage into predefined categories, such as recyclable, organic, or hazardous. The goal is to create an intelligent system that can assist in the waste management process and contribute to sustainability.
Project Overview

In this project, We trained different deep learning models to classify garbage images into specific categories. I experimented with various CNN architectures and used transfer learning techniques to optimize the models. The project aims to contribute to automated waste management by leveraging AI and computer vision.
Key Features:

- Image Classification: The project focuses on classifying garbage images into categories such as recyclable, organic, or hazardous waste.

- Transfer Learning: Pretrained models like ResNet and VGG were fine-tuned on a custom garbage dataset to improve accuracy.

- Model Optimization: Techniques such as data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and fine-tuning were applied to enhance the performance of the models.

Technologies Used:

    Python
    TensorFlow / Keras
    OpenCV for image processing
    Matplotlib for data visualization
    NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation

Project Goals:

    Explore and experiment with different deep learning models for garbage image classification.
    Leverage transfer learning to improve the model's efficiency.
    Contribute to the development of automated waste management solutions using AI.
